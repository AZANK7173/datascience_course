    "Welcome to the NLP (Natural Language Processing) Series, developed by Visagio and Digital House! In this series, you will be introduced to the NLP world: what exactly is NLP and why is it important for a Data Scientist to know it? What are the current main applications? How can we solve a real problem with NLP? <br>\n",
    "All these questions will be answered in this 3 classes series. In this 1st class,  we will:\n",
    " - what is NLP\n",
    " - understand why NLP presents a different challenge compared to 'normal' datasets (like the Titanic or IMDb Score)\n",
    " - the some fundamental approaches to NLP\n",
    " - the best practices when dealing with an NLP problem (cleaning, visualizing etc)\n",
    " - how to tackle problems with this basic NLP algorithm\n",
    " - some ways of diving deeper into NLP\n",
    " \n",
    "Ready? Let's go! <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The series 'How to Data Science' was written and developed by Abelardo Fukasawa. I'm a Data Scientist at Visagio and a Machine Learning Researcher at USP's Grupo Turing. Feel free to contact me on my __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abelardofukasawa/)__ or my __[GitHub](https://github.com/abefukasawa)__ :) <br>\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## So, what is Natural Language Processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "In science fiction (a genre that I love!) it is pretty common to see robots or other artificial agents communicating seamlessly with humans. Not through command lines in a terminal nor specific reserved commands, but talking the way we talk. Take Blade Runner's JOI or Star Wars's C-3PO, for example. They manage to interact with other character's simply by speaking in their language. In other words, these intelligent artificial agents, at least the ones depicted in these stories, can comprehend and reproduce the way we use language to communicate - the natural language. <br>\n",
    "This is a common way of thinking about the goal of NLP: to develop agents that can communicate with us, naturally, in order to have a better relation/interface with humans. Therefore, **NLP is a field that brings together Machine Learning and Linguistics in order to create agents that can understand and reproduce our 'human way of communicating'**. And that's pretty much about it! It may sound simple, but NLP presents a totally different challenge from 'raw data' Data Science and Machine Learning. <br>\n",
    "Some famous applications for NLP are word correctors, Google Duplex, personal assistants (Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana),  Amazon Alexa and Chatbots!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "PS: NLP can be broken down into NLU (Natural Language Understanding) and NLG (Natural Language generation). They are instrinsically connected, but are two very different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is NLP a separate and challenging field?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, let's remember a very traditional challenge/dataset from Kaggle - the IMDb Score. The goal of this challenge is to predict the score a given movie would receive. There are plenty of parameters: movie budget, revenue, cast, director,  facebook likes etc. So, after cleaning, reducing dimensionality and doing a little bit of feature engineering, you may have applied something like an ensemble algorithm, or a neural net for the fancy ones, and boom - you get a result. You had a multidimensional input and your algorithm discovered the mapping function between them and the desired output. Great, simple, fast. You may have used a little bit of knowledge (cof,  guessing?) about movies in order to do your feature engineering, but you didn't have to deeply understand how movies are made, how the color palette is used by directors to convey emotions, neither the art references the piece did. In other words, for IMDb score, you don't have to be a movie expert - you use math to discover the best features and you're done.\n",
    "NLP does not work this way. As languages have their own words, morphology, semantic, syntax and syntagmas, there are linguistic rules into your dataset. Let's take a simple example:\n",
    " - the brown dog ate the red apple\n",
    " - the red dog ate the brown apple\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "The 2 sentences up here depict two different scenes, even though they carry different meanings. in the first one, I see a beautiful dog eating a nice apple. In the second one, I see a quite odd dog (would it be a pok√©mon? Never saw a red dog) eating a rotten apple - ew. Language is not only about content, it's about structures, time and context. Because of this, NLP is considered an area inside machine learning - a quite interesting and challenging one. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Classification using Naive Bayes in News\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok,  we talked a lot about NLP, let's get our hands dirty and start coding! For now, we will be using the __[20 newsgroups dataset](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/)__. The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. It is built-in scikit learn, so there's no need to get from external resources.\n",
    "We will begin using a pretty common algorithm: *Naive bayes*! Although simple, *Naive Bayes* can be quite useful, not only performance-wise, but also to set a baseline to your models. It is a simple and fast algorithm to begin your experimentations.\n",

    "### Step 2: Convert words into features - the Bag of Words model\n",
    "\n",
    "As we just saw, our dataset is a collection of words. The first and most fundamental approach is to understand language by it's contents. I know, my first example this can be a trap, but can extract powerful information about the text's theme from its contents. Even though those 2 sentences carried different meanings, they both referenced a dog eating an apple. If we want to classify texts by their themes, this may be very useful! <br>\n",
    "Ok, but we can't feed our dataset as it is in a *Naive Bayes* algorithm. It deals with features, not strings. Well, texts are just a bunch of ordered strings, so we can convert these strings into vectors. We will do this by using the *Bag of Words* model (I'm lazy, imma call it BoW, okay?)!\n",
    "Briefly, we segment each text file into words (for English splitting by space), and count # of times each word occurs in each document and finally assign each word an integer id. Each unique word in our dictionary will correspond to a feature (descriptive feature). Therefore, the BoW columns will be composed of all the words in our dataset (not just of a document, but from all documents), and each line of our BoW matrix will be a document. Each element in this BoW matrix will show how many times a given word (column) appears in each line (document). Scikit-learn has a high level component which will create feature vectors for us ‚ÄòCountVectorizer‚Äô <br>\n",
